 * @class HomotopyClassPlanner
 * @brief Local planner that explores alternative homotopy classes, create a plan for each alternative
 *	  and finally return the robot controls for the current best path (repeated in each sampling interval)
 * 
 * Homotopy classes are explored using the help a search-graph. \n
 * A couple of possible candidates are sampled / generated and filtered afterwards such that only a single candidate
 * per homotopy class remain. Filtering is applied using the H-Signature, a homotopy (resp. homology) invariant: \n
 *      - S. Bhattacharya et al.: Search-based Path Planning with Homotopy Class Constraints, AAAI, 2010
 *      - C. Rösmann et al.: Planning of Multiple Robot Trajectories in Distinctive Topologies, ECMR, 2015.
 * 
 * Followed by the homotopy class search, each candidate is used as an initialization for the underlying trajectory
 * optimization (in this case utilizing the TebOptimalPlanner class with the TimedElasticBand). \n
 * Depending on the config parameters, the optimization is performed in parallel. \n
 * After the optimization is completed, the best optimized candidate is selected w.r.t. to trajectory cost, since the 
 * cost already contains important features like clearance from obstacles and transition time. \n
 * 
 * Everyhting is performed by calling one of the overloaded plan() methods. \n
 * Afterwards the velocity command to control the robot is obtained from the "best" candidate 
 * via getVelocityCommand(). \n
 * 
 * All steps are repeated in the subsequent sampling interval with the exception, that already planned (optimized) trajectories
 * are preferred against new path initilizations in order to improve the hot-starting capability.
