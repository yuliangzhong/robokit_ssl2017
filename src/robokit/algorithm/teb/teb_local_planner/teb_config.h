  *	     E.g. if \e base_local_planner is utilized as plugin for the navigation stack, the initialize() method will register a

  * 	     All parameters considered by the dynamic_reconfigure server (and their \b default values) are

  * 	     In addition the rosparam server can be queried to get parameters e.g. defiend in a launch file.
  * 	     The plugin source (or a possible binary source) can call loadRosParamFromNodeHandle() to update the parameters.
